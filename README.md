# Spatio-Temporal Model Checker


This project is the implementation of the spatio-temporal model checker for the logic [LOGIC_NAME].

## Logic Syntax
The syntax used here follows the one from the paper. The table below consists of the operators permitted and the corresponding symbols parsable by the model checker:

| Operator    | Symbols |
| -------- | ------- |
| Logical Truth | ⊤    |
| Logical Falsity| ⊥     |
| Logical Negation    | ¬/~/!   |
| Logical And    | ∧/&   |
| Logical Or    | \|   |
| Logical Implication    | →/->   |
| Logical Bi-implication    | <->   |
| Spatial Front    | Front  |
| Spatial Back    | Back  |
| Spatial Left    | Left  |
| Spatial Right    | Right  |
| Temporal Next | X|
| Temporal Eventually | F|
| Temporal Always | G|
| Temporal Until | U|
 | At Operator | @ |
| Bind Operator | ↓ |

Furthermore, propositions can be any string generated by the regular expression `[a-y][a-y0-9_]*`.
Names for nominals can be generated using the following regular expression `z[0-9_]*`.
